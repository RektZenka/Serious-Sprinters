# Serious Sprinters
# A few things about the game.
1. This probably won't get a full release on Steam or anything, this is just practice for making multiplayer and other stuff I did not know how to do before
2. Multiplayer uses Photon for now and probably forever, I need to add animation syncing, but that's not important for right now.
